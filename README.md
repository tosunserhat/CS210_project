# CS210_project
Personal Data Science Project for my CS210 Course

When I talked to my peers most of them were planning to make the project about spotify or instagram so I decided to go with something different, tiktok. 
I used tiktok because it is the app that I spend most of time, and there is a various time data about it. 
My hypthesis was to analyse the difference of tiktok usage related to the periods of years such as academic periods, seasonal periods and monthly periods,and interpret that mostly on holidays and summer I am using tiktok. 
And all the findings that you can read from the presentation are supporting my hypothesis, For example my login history and browing history are uprising in the summer and holiday periods and downing in the exam and winter periods.
